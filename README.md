# Image-Classifier-Cat-Tail

This is a somewhat rudimentary image classification model that is trained on a small amount of data to recognize whether a tail is present in a picture of a cat or not, using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Although the model is trained on cat pictures, it demonstrably generalizes to pictures of other animals such as dogs.

The project is contained in the Jupyter notebook ImageClassification.ipynb, which can be run on Google Colaboratory if this repository is mounted to your Google Drive. Pycharm Professional is also an option.
